# Kidney Stone Detection Project

## Description
This project aims to develop an image processing system to detect the presence of kidney stones in medical images. The system is designed to preprocess kidney images and analyze them to identify potential stone regions.

## Features
- Image preprocessing to enhance image quality.
- Segmentation of images to isolate areas of interest.
- Detection of kidney stones based on pixel intensity and shape analysis.
- User-friendly interface for uploading images in various formats.

## Requirements
- MATLAB (preferably) for image processing.
- Image formats supported: .png, .jpg, etc.

## Installation Instructions
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have MATLAB installed.
3. Open the project files in MATLAB.

## Usage
1. Upload kidney images using the provided functionality.
2. The system will preprocess the images and apply filtering techniques.
3. The detection result will be displayed, indicating whether a kidney stone is present.

## Acknowledgments
- This project utilizes image processing techniques to enhance medical diagnostics.
